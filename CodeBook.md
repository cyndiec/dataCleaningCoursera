# The Codebook
### What the script does
1. Installs/updates the dplyr package and loads it.

2. Creates a character vector containing the feature variable names.

3. Creates a data frame containg the x_test data, i.e., the primary data table, with the features as the column names.

4. Creates vectors containing the subject and activity values associated with the test data.

5. Creates a vector containing the value 'test' to identify that these are test values. This will be in the type column.

6. Appends the subject, activity values, and type column to the primary data frame. Edits column names to ensure they are descriptive.

7. Repeats steps 3 through 6 but with train data. This means the type column contains the value 'train'.

8. Combines these two data frames to create one large data set containing the training and test datasets.

9. Creates a vector to identify which features contain the terms mean or std to identify the mean and standard deviation columns. Does not include mean frequencies as these are not means per se, but frequencies of means.

10. Edits large data set so it only has mean and standard deviation measurements.

11. Extracts the activities label information to create a lookup.

12. Renames the activity values in the large data set so that they are activity labels.

13. Creates a new data set by grouping by subject and activity and calculating the means of all columns except Type. Type is not relevant for this final data set.

14. Writes new data set to a file, and specifies that rows do not have names.

###Summary
We merged the train and test data, and appended activities and subjects. We then extracted the mean and standard deviation measures, and calculated the means of these columns for each activity and subject pair.

###General information about data
According to the publishers of the original data, these experiments were carried out on 30 volunteers aging between 19 and 48 years. These subjects are identified in the column 'subject'. Measurements were taken using the embedded acccelerometer and gyroscope of their smartphone while they did six activities. These activities are identified in the column 'activity'.

The other columns are means of the standard deviation and mean columns of the original measuremen
ts. **The original measurements are normalized values ranging from -1 to 1 of time domain signals and frequency domain signals. Since they are normalized they have no units.** A number of filters were applied to remove noise.
